      "content": "The Technical Specifications document provides comprehensive details for the next-generation product platform, encompassing system architecture, performance requirements, security protocols, and integration specifications.\n\nSystem Architecture: The platform utilizes a microservices-based architecture with containerized deployment using Kubernetes. Core components include an API gateway (maximum response time: 200ms), distributed caching layer (Redis), message queue (RabbitMQ), and polyglot persistence layer supporting both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases.\n\nPerformance Requirements: The system must support 10,000 concurrent users with 99.9% uptime SLA. API endpoints must respond within 200ms for 95th percentile requests, with database queries optimized to complete within 50ms. The platform should handle 1,000 requests per second at peak load with horizontal scaling capabilities.\n\nSecurity: Implementation requires OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for authentication, AES-256 encryption for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit, and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization. All sensitive data must be encrypted, with audit logging for compliance requirements.\n\nIntegration: The platform exposes RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints for third-party integrations. Webhook support enables real-time event notifications. The system includes comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI 3.0 specification.\n\nInfrastructure: Cloud-native deployment on AWS using EC2, RDS, S3, and CloudFront. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) managed through Terraform with CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.",
